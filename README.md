# World of balls
I'm not quite done with all of the bug fixes from godot updating. The game was originally created in godot 3.x but is continuing in godot 4.2.

The tutorial as of right now is not done it only has one slide. So pretty much to play the game you use left and right arrow keys to control. Red balls you want to hit. If you miss the red balls you lose a life. Orange spikey/hairy balls you do not want to hit them. If you hit them you lose a life.
